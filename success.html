	<h1>SUCCESS</h1>
	<p>
So, today I would like to write about something that people
worry about a lot. I will talk about self esteem, self control
and self motivation.<br/><br/>
Everyone out there in this grand world is worried only about
one thing. And that my friend, is not happiness. It is
success.<br/><br/>
Everyone wants to be successful. But, do we really
understand the true meaning of this word - "Success".<br/><br/>
I feel that success is one of those things that differ from
person to person. Everyone has a different meaning of
success. So, what do you think causes this difference in
meanings? According to me there are two factors:<br/><br/>
<snap id="head">1. Experience:</snap><br/><br/> People with different levels of experience
and different types of experience give different meanings to
success. A man who has seen poverty his entire life, defines
wealth as success. A person who is suffering from a deadly
disease defines success as health and a person who is
differentialy abled just thinks that a person who has each
part intact is successful. Anyways, so people only define
success as something which they were not been able to
achieve and overcome in their life. So people with different
types of experiences end up in giving different definitions.
Now, for amount of experience, you know that people of
different ages tend to look up to a problem from very
different aspects. For example, a young man would find it
very easy to climb a hill, and it may not be a big deal for
him. But when the same work is done by an old man, when an
old man climbs a hill, it is hell of a success for him. So our
age matters a lot in our definition of success.<br/><br/>
<snap id="head">2. Fear:</snap><br/><br/> So, we come to know that everyone defines success
differently, but all of them have one thing in common, and
that is fear. You see, fear is a strong agent. It induces an
energy which is dark, but very useful. A person who is able
to avert his/her nightmare is said to be successful for
himself. An orphan who had feared of living alone forever,
when gets a family feels completely successful. A child who
has slept with empty stomach, when eats everything he/she
wants to, then they feel successful.<br/><br/>
 But, what really is success. For me "When a man conquers
himself and knows his limits, accepts them, and then tries to
push them, he emerges as someone with a lot of experience,
self esteem and confidence, and such a man is said to be
successful."<br/><br/>
 I belong to a small district in Bihar. Out here things are
difficult. By difficult I mean difficult lifestyle, difficult
thinking and the major dufficulty is resistivity to change
(Just like Newton's first law of motion). People don't want to
change their thinking, rather they wish to impose it on the
next generation. And, this I think, is a major reason for
drawback of the State of Bihar. I wouldn't want to give our
talks a political view. So,the thought is all that matters.<br/><br/>
 Our society began with a very absurd and confusing system
called 'Barter System'. It was in many ways revolutionary. It
changed the thought of people that everyone should
necesserily do agriculture. This system led them to discover
their talent and help build a better society. But, we are
humans. We always modify things to simplify our lives, but
end up in distorting ourselves. So, the barter faced some
problem of quantitative measurement. It means that there
was no reference. What would a person get in return of a
shoe? Can he get a gold necklace? Yes, I understand that it
sounds funny. But that was the time when money did not
exist.So, why are we talking about this? It is to be
understood that it has always been this barter which we are
doing. But I feel that people are going back again to the
early man stage. They want to take away all the opportunities
and lead their children to a well defined so called 'safe
paths'. But that's not the complete truth, is it? Actually,
life begins at the end of your comfort zone. And this fact is
to be understood to lead a successful life. After doing
eveything that society wants us to do, there is a part where
you have some responsibility towards enhancing your talents,
and that can only happen when you get out of your comfort
zone.<br/><br/>
 One of the favourite dialouges of Indian Parents is "We
just want to see you settled." How much is this sensible? Is
doing a job from morning to evening and getting a good pay
better than working for half the time for half the money? I
don't understand, what does settlement mean to everyone? Is
it about giving away your life to earn enough money for the
next generation, or is it about living your life happily and give
the children something more useful than money-'Experience'?
Either way you are happy. Some people just like to earn
money for others, that's really good, I know. But does that
mean everyone should? No. Not at all. To be settled in life
means to be happy. So I suggest you my friends, that if you
can get your life, at the cost of earning less money, go for
it. Because, in this senario, you will gain something more
beautiful and soothing. You will get to know what life is and
how beautifully you have lived it. But after all it only depends
on you. On what gives you happiness. That's all that matters.
Just remember one thing- There are many things in the world
which are worth more than money, including yourself. So,
never give away youself for a piece of paper.<br/><br/>
 This was a more of emotional entry and not much
scientific.But there are sometimes when we need to see
things from a different perspective.<br/><br/>
 So, best of luck for your life and your success!!!!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
